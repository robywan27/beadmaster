Board game in Java (November 2015). For this project, I modeled the logic of a simple board-game in Java, whose rules can be found in the file https://github.com/robywan27/beadmaster/blob/master/BeadMaster_Gameplay.pdf.

As a further development this model could be plugged into an application (e.g. Android app).
